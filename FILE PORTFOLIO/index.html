                    <h3>IMPLEMENTING COOLING RODS IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS</h3>
                    <p>This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate the scheduling and reminders for cooling rod replacements in nuclear reactors. By analyzing textual data from maintenance logs and operational reports, the system identifies key indicators related to cooling rod lifespan and deterioration. It employs machine learning algorithms to predict optimal replacement times based on historical data and current operational conditions. The implementation aims to enhance operational efficiency, ensure regulatory compliance, and minimize downtime by proactively managing cooling rod maintenance schedules through automated notifications and alerts.</p>
